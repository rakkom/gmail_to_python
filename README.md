# gmail_to_python

It reads specific email contents and run python codes

You need zapier for this code.
Zapier takes tweets from a specific account such as @elonmusk and send email to a Gmail account.
Then this code reads emails sent to your Gmail account and run python code.

But unfortunately, there is a time lag.
It takes around 5 mins to receive the email from Zapier since the account tweets.
So it is not useful for me.

But I will just leave the code here.
