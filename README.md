# Overview

This code is designed to read specific email content and execute Python code. To use it, you will need Zapier. Zapier retrieves tweets from a designated account (such as @elonmusk) and sends an email to your Gmail account. The code then reads the emails received in your Gmail account and runs the corresponding Python code.

However, there is a significant time lag associated with this process. It typically takes around five minutes to receive the email from Zapier after the account tweets, which may not be useful for some applications.

Nevertheless, I have included the code here for reference.

# Necessary files

credentials.json: This is the authentication credentials file for a project created in Google Cloud Platform. It is required to access the Gmail API. You can create a project in the GCP Console, enable the Gmail API, and create an OAuth 2.0 client ID to download. The generated JSON file should be saved as credentials.json.

token.pickle: This file is automatically generated upon the first execution of the code. If the authentication is successful, the user's access token will be stored in this file. If this file exists, the access token will be loaded without prompting for authentication again. Since this file is generated during the initial execution, there is no need to prepare it in advance.

# Disclaimer

This code was primarily generated by ChatGPT. However, I have not yet had the opportunity to test it due to the time lag associated with the process.
