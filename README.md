# What it is about

It reads specific email contents and run python codes

You need zapier for this code.
Zapier takes tweets from a specific account such as @elonmusk and send email to a Gmail account.
Then this code reads emails sent to your Gmail account and run python code.

But unfortunately, there is a time lag.
It takes around 5 mins to receive the email from Zapier since the account tweets.
So it is not useful for me.

But I will just leave the code here.

# Necessary files

credentials.json: This is the authentication credentials file for a project created in Google Cloud Platform. It is required to access the Gmail API. You can create a project in the GCP Console, enable the Gmail API, and create an OAuth 2.0 client ID to download. The generated JSON file should be saved as credentials.json.

token.pickle: This file is automatically generated upon the first execution of the code. If the authentication is successful, the user's access token will be stored in this file. If this file exists, the access token will be loaded without prompting for authentication again. Since this file is generated during the initial execution, there is no need to prepare it in advance.

# Disclaimer

This code is mainly generated by ChatGPT and I didn't try it because of the time lag.
